"Volcanoes of the World" is a database describing the physical characteristics of volcanoes and their eruptions. This search returns a list of eruptions sorted by date. Results may be downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet. The download includes eruption type, maximum Volcanis Explosivity Index, start and end dates (when known), and the type of evidence for the eruption. A second spreadsheet page contains a list of events related to each eruption. References that contain eruption-related content used in the database is on a third page.
