# Mortgage default
-----------------
### Objectives
The aim of this project is to develop a model to predict if a mortgage from the dataset will default in its remaining lifetime given what the information known about the mortgage at the time of its first observation.


### Description
The project is developed in Python and presented in a Jupiter notebook.
Steps included in the process:
* 1 - EDA: quality of data, outliers detection, data cleaning
* 2 - Correlation of features
* 3 - Develop model 1 for prediction: specifying model type and the reasons for its choice
* 4 - Parameter tuning and GridSearchCV, metrics choice and reasons, show performance in folds
* 5 - Feature importance and selection
* 6 - Model 2 using
* 8 - Models comparison
* 9 - Conclusion
