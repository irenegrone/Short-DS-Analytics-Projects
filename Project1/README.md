## In development
-----------------
Steps
* 1 - EDA: quality of data, outliers detection, data cleaning
* 2 - correlated features, significance testing to assess difference between groups
* 3 - Feature engineering
* 4 - Develop model 1 for prediction/regression: model type and reasons
* 5 - parameter tuning and GridSearchCV, metrics choice and reasons, show performance in folds
* 6 - feature importance and selection
* 7 - model 2, model 3: same steps
* 8 - model comparison
* 9 - conclusion
